# PacMen-Factory
## The PacMen Factory generates the yellow PacMan character endlessly. Plus, as an added feature, the more you click on the "Let's Go!" button, the faster they go!
### How to Run: To start off, click the "Add PacMan" button on the PacMen_Alexa html file. After doing that, if you click the "Let's Go!" button, then you'd make it bounce around faster and faster. Don't worry: it won't ever leave your screen, and you can generate endless PacMen. If things get too fast, just reload/refresh and you'll be back at the start.
###IMPORTANT NOTE: The "ByePacMan!" is in development, as I am trying to enable the ability to take PacMen away. Stay tuned for updates!
